    The Dialogue <em>dan</em> concludes with a congruent chant that increases
    the Intermedia Index. The jiutai speaks for the young boy, as it delivers
    the chant. Its poetic text carries the boy’s words of encouragements for
    Munechika. It is set in <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the
    hand-percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting and a non-congruent
    nohkan's part. The dramatic expression is very much heightened by the use of
    formal <em>kata</em> that align well with the musical changes but not the
    boy’s words. Against his words of encouragement, the movements of the two
    characters appear to display the mistrust and tension between them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Munechika is clearly uneasy about meeting an unfamiliar boy who knows so
    much about him. He is not reassured when the boy says, "<em
      >Walls have ears: In a world where rocks may speak…</em
    >". The distrust between the two characters becomes clear when they

    <time datetime="00:15:00.000" title="00:15:00">break eye contact</time>

    and turn away from each other. This happens shortly before the

    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >, which separates the <em>ageuta’s</em> first line of text from its
    repetition. The powerful <em>kakegoe ‘iya’</em> and the nohkan’s

    <a href="/music/nohkan-examples/#hishigi-takane" target="_blank"
      ><em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em></a
    >

    pattern, energize the music and carry the melodic line that follows the
    repetition into the higher range, emphasizing the corresponding words. In
    this case, the word "<em
      ><time datetime="00:15:37.000" title="00:15:37">kakure</time></em
    >", which means ‘hidden’, maintains the feeling of distrust when the two
    protagonists continue to keep their distance from each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon hearing a reference to the "<em
      ><time datetime="00:16:04.000" title="00:16:04"
        >radiance of the Emperor’s sword</time
      ></em
    >," the two characters turn towards each another, attempting one more time
    to establish trust. The shite even goes as far as to take three steps
    towards the waki, but the effort is in vain, and ultimately fails when the
    shite turns away from the waki and circles to Square 1. The nohkan
    underlines the tense situation with the entrance of the

    <a href="/music/nohkan-examples/#naka-no-takane" target="_blank"
      ><em>naka no takane</em></a
    >

    pattern.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally,

    <time datetime="00:16:30.000" title="00:16:30"
      >after rebuilding momentum</time
    >

    with a

    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a>

    and an

    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, the two
    protagonists once again turn towards each other, and as the jiutai intones
    the words "<em>[The sword] must be realized</em>," the shite takes One Step
    towards the waki, suggesting that the communication line between the two is
    now open.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although subtle, the changes in the music structure follow the unfolding
    narrative. The three attempts to establish trust between the boy and the
    swordsmith are matched with three changes in the delivery mode, from the
    declamatory

    <a href="/music/voices/#Mitsuji-Utai" target="_blank"
      ><em>mitsuji-utai</em></a
    >, used to set up the attempt, to the rhythmic

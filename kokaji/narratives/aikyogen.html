    The kyōgen actor personifies a deity, that is why he is masked and his
    entrance accompanied with music. In Kokaji's case, he enters the stage over
    the music of <em>raijo</em>. The intermedia character of the interlude is
    simple, as it is usually the case. The actor recites his text with very
    little movement and no music.
  </p>

  <p>
    Often during the interlude, also called the <em>nakairi</em>, the kyōgen
    actor has a discussion with the waki. In such instances, he kneels center
    stage and talks with the waki, who is kneeling at

    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 5</a>, as it is the
    case in Hashitomi’s

    <a href="/hashitomi/aikyogen/" target="_blank"><em>aikyōgen</em></a
    >. But in Kokaji, the waki has exited the stage with the shite for a change
    of costume, so the kyōgen actor recites a monologue while standing on Square
    1. Like the members of the jiutai, the four musicians have their hands in
    their pockets to show that although on stage, they are not part of the
    action.

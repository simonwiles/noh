    Although the Intermedia Index of this spoken dialogue remains low, there is
    an interesting intermedia quality that comes from the use of stage space and
    the setting of the text.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kokaji’s first act does not have a 'Shite Enters' <em>dan</em> since his
    appearance is a surprise, an effect that would have been spoiled with an
    entrance music. Instead, the <em>shōdan</em> opens with the shite's first
    line of a dialogue. It comes as a <em>yobikake</em>, a call from the
    distance, when the shite is still out of sight in the mirror room. The waki,
    standing on

    <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 6</a>

    and facing in his direction, is

    <time datetime="00:12:53.000" title="00:12:53">mesmerized</time>, and
    wonders about who is addressing him. Then, the shite enters and engages in a
    dialogue with the waki, separated from him by the

    <time datetime="00:13:09.000" title="00:13:09"
      >widest possible distance</time
    >, which creates the dramatic effect of being worlds apart.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the shite in the role of a young boy finally reaches Square 1 and turns
    to face Munechika, the

    <time datetime="00:14:46.000" title="00:14:46">tone and style</time>

    of delivery of the last two lines of the <em>shōdan</em> change suddenly.
    The actors switch to non-congruent singing to share a sentence of poetic
    text. The waki says a line that summarizes his astonishment : "<em
      >A voice in heaven</em
    >." It is followed with the shite’s "<em>echoes on the earth,</em>" which
    confirms his arrival in Munechika’s world. This switch also serves as a
    smooth transition to the next <em>shōdan</em>, whose poetic text is also
    sung.

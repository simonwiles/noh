    Although the Intermedia Index drops slightly because the nohkan is not
    involved in the <em>shōdan</em>, overall it remains very high because of the
    richness of movement and congruency of the music. The shite and jiutai
    alternate as narrators, describing the strongly mimetic action of sword
    forging the audience is watching. Text and <em>kata</em> are in perfect
    synchrony, as motions visualize the text, which itself involves onomatopea
    to strengthen the 'realistic' quality of the scene.

    The <em>noriji-3</em> can be divided into three segments, each beginning the
    taiko's head pattern

    <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a
    >. In the first segment we are told that the deity is a young boy who
    ascends the forge mound before bowing to the waki. During the next segment,
    the deity asks Munechika to

    <time datetime="00:54:58.000" title="00:54:58">bring the metal</time>

    to be forged into a blade. He obliges, and as they proceed with their work,
    by alternating hammering, they imitated the sound of the hit metal with the
    onomatopoeic: ‘chō’. In the third segment, the text highlights the
    magnificence of the event. As the jiutai narrates that the

    <time datetime="00:55:55.000" title="00:55:55"
      >strokes sound through heaven and earth</time
    >, the shite jumps out of the dais, covering his head with his sleeves to
    indicate that he has temporarily disappeared from the location. His
    Up-Left-Right-Down Head motion suggests, however, that he can hear the sound
    of the strokes bouncing off through space. This is followed by the waki’s
    Left-Right Head motion, confirming that he can also hear it.

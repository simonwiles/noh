      The <em>shōdan</em> is divided into two parts: <em>notto</em>-music,
      followed by the <em>notto</em>-chant. The <em>notto</em>-music includes
      parts for the two hand-percussion in

      and the nohkan is in

      rhythmic setting. It is followed by the <em>notto</em>-chant where the
      nohkan is replaced with a

      chant sung in <em>tsuyogin</em> style by the waki.

      The waki walks back on stage and kneels on

      <a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Square 8</a>, in front
      of the <em>hayashi</em> as it performs the <em>notto</em>-music. As the
      <em>notto</em>-chant is about to start, he walks to front-stage to a
      <em>tsukurimono</em> that represents his forge. After mounting it, he
      kneels and picks up a sacred wand.

    The <em>notto</em> opens the second act with an Intermedia Index in medium
    range, as if the drama was picking up where it left off at the end of the
    first act.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>notto</em> begins with a lively musical introduction. The percussion
    parts are in strict rhythmic setting. The kotsuzumi player sets the tone by
    playing the steady <em>notto uchitsume</em> pattern characterized by a
    stroke on each of the <em>honji’s</em> eight beats. Both the kotsuzumi
    pattern and the non-congruent nohkan’s part are exclusively used in the

    <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/notto-music" target="_blank"
      ><em>notto</em>-music</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Munechika is waiting in a kneeling position at Square 8, facing diagonally
    away from the audience, as if absent. About half-way through the
    introduction music, he stands up and walks towards the

    <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>dais</em></a>

    -representing his forge- steps on it, and kneels. Picking up a sacred wand
    with his right hand, he performs a purifying ritual.
  </p>

  <p>
    The text of the <em>notto</em>-chant, set in <em>sashinori</em>, is loosely
    synchronized with the accompaniment. Most of its lines fit in the eight-beat
    span between two successive

    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-sounds" target="_blank"><em>chon</em></a>

    strokes of the ōtsuzumi. These fall on <em>honji’s</em>

    <time datetime="00:45:56.000" title="00:45:56">third beat</time>, and are
    preceded by a slight slowdown and an extended kakegoe. Longer lines -which
    do not fit in the eight-beat span between two successive
    <em>chon</em> strokes- are spread over three or four <em>honji</em>. In this
    case, there is no rallentando leading to the intermediate
    <em>chon</em> stroke(s), and during the intermediate <em>honji</em> the
    ōtsuzumi performs a sequence of four, five, or six <em>chon</em> strokes,
    which

    <time datetime="00:47:23.000" title="00:47:23">maintain the momentum</time>.
  </p>

  <p>
    From time to time the chant slows down to emphasize selected words. This
    happens, for instance, when Munechika acknowledges that his craft came to
    him through

    <time datetime="00:47:08.000" title="00:47:08"> no effort of his own</time>

    with the line ‘<em>chikara ni arazu</em>.' Important words are also
    emphasized with a combination of rhythm and pitch. For example, when
    Munechika raises the wand and prays for divine help in completing his task,
    the line lasts three <em>honji</em>, and its syllables are spread to create
    a rallentando on the words: “<time datetime="00:46:29.000" title="00:46:29"
      >...I make my petition.</time
    >” The stress on the keyword ‘<em>sasage</em>’ is emphasized when Munechika
    changes his steady tone by raising his pitch, followed by a descending
    glissando. In this case, the effect could indicate an expression of
    commitment toward the fulfillment of the imperial order.

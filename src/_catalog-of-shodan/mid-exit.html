    <p>
      The First Act exit of a shite personifying a deity, could be accompanied
      by an exit music, such as a

      <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/raijo"><em>Raijo</em> </a>. This is the case
      in Kokaji. In Hashitomi, the shite personifies a humble young lady, thus,
      it is in silence that she leaves the stage. The slow yet balanced steps
      fill the silence with air of dignity.

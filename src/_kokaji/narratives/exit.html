    The exit of the actors and musicians happens in silence. The shite is the
    first one to exit, followed by the waki. If a <em>tsukurimono</em> was used
    in the play, the stage assistants would remove it next. Once the actor or
    stage assistant has passed the Second Pine, the curtain rises and then falls
    once he has entered the anteroom. From this point, the musicians exit in the
    same order they entered, the nokhan player first, followed by the kotsuzumi,
    ≈çtsuzumi,and taiko players. Upon reaching the Second Pine, the curtain is
    pulled back on one side to allow for the musicians' exit. The jiutai members
    exit through the back left side door, starting with the back row members. As
    they are exiting the stage, actors, assistants and musicians exhibit modesty
    and decorum. The audience holds its applause until the last musician is
    about to exit.

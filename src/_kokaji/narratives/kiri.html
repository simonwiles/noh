      The sword, called 'Clustering Clouds of Heaven', is celebrated with a
      dance. The deity proclaims the end of its work, offers the sword to the
      Imperial envoy, and jumps on a cloud to return to Mt. Inari.

      The dance of this dance-to-text <em>shōdan</em> uses most of the stage
      space. The shite takes the blade, performs a few <em>kata</em> holding it,
      then brings it to the envoy while the waki watches them. The envoy accepts
      the blade, the shite bows and performs a short sequence of <em>kata</em>,
      ending by walking onto the bridge and stopping at the Second Pine where he
      mimes his disappearance.

    The final <em>shōdan</em> of the play involves active dance, congruent
    singing, percussion in strict rhythmic setting, and a striking closing
    pattern by the nohkan. This brings the Intermedia Index to its second
    highest point. The mimetic movement matches the text, and the fast music
    underlines the climactic character of the section.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>kiri</em> can be divided into three parts: introducing the sword as
    'Clustering Clouds of Heaven', boasting of its powers as it is offered to
    the envoy, and the deity’s exit.
  </p>

  <p>
    To emphasize the name of the sword, an inserted measure of four-beat
    (<em>toriji</em>) interrupts the steady flow of the <em>honji</em>. It
    creates a pause that stresses the name “<em>Ama no murakumo…</em>” (<time
      datetime="00:56:57.000"
      title="00:56:57"
      >"Clustering Clouds of Heaven..."</time
    >). The deity shows the sword by performing the standard sequence of
    <em>kata</em>:

    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a>

    and

    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, while
    holding the blade up high at arm's length.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second part begins with the deity looking at the sword held between
    stretched arms and

    <time datetime="00:57:11.000" title="00:57:11"
      >pronouncing: 'First under heaven'</time
    >. Then, the jiutai repeats the claim and tells about the protection and
    blessings that the sword will bring. The dance’s momentum picks up until the
    end of the <em>kiri</em>. The shite reinforces the statements with a series
    of

    <a href="/movement/ six-and-seven/" target="_blank">Six and Seven Stamps</a
    >, which produces a

    <time datetime="00:57:19.000" title="00:57:19"
      >dynamic counterpoint with the melodic line</time
    >. The text that follows speaks of ruling the land to the four seas and the
    abundance of the five staple crops. It is mimicked with a loosely
    synchronized sequence of formal <em>kata</em>:

    <time datetime="00:57:40.000" title="00:57:40"
      >Pointing and Large Circle </time
    >. As the jiutai sings, “<em
      >Inari no shintai Kogitsune-maru wo/The manifestation of Inari: the Little
      Fox</em
    >,” the shite prepares to formally deliver the blade by performing an

    <time datetime="00:57:52.000" title="00:57:52">Open-retreat</time>

    that brings him back to Square 1. In an intense moment, the deity, holding
    the sword with two hands, walks towards the Emperor's envoy, hands the blade
    to him, moves back, Kneel, and Bow.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final section of the text starts, "<em
      >kore made nari to ii-sutete/Now, I am done!</em
    >", and brings a change of tone created by a

    <time datetime="00:58:07.000" title="00:58:07">sudden spike in tempo</time>

    of both music and dance. The deity stands up and performs several

    <time datetime="00:58:15.000" title="00:58:15">virtuosic</time>

    <em>kata</em> with spectacular agility: Two Large Steps, a

    <a href="/movement/leap-turn/" target="_blank">Leap Turn</a>, and a sequence
    of

    <a href="/ movement/multiple/" target="_blank">Kneeling</a>

    that mimic the words "<em
      >mata mura-kumo ni tobi-nori/he leaps upon the mass of clouds</em
    >." The closing nohkan’s <em>tome no te</em> pattern confirms the finality
    of the situation as the deity moves with determination to the Second Pine on
    the Bridge. Once more he takes Two Large Steps in preparation for a Leap
    Turn,

    <time datetime="00:58:26.000" title="00:58:26"
      >illustrating his return to Mt. Inari</time
    >, as the jiutai sings: "<em
      >Higashiyama Inari no mine ni zo kaerikeru/and returns to the Eastern Peak
      of Mt. Inari!</em
    >." Finally, the deity flips his left sleeve over his head to indicate his
    disappearance from view, while Munechika keeps his gaze into the distance,
    as if seeing the deity off.

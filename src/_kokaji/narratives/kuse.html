<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <p>
    This <em>shōdan</em> represents the dramatic highlight of the first act,
    recounting heroic battles and introducing the play’s first dance-to-text
    section. The poetic text, which includes the shite's three
    <em>ageha</em> lines, is set in <em>hiranori</em>. It is sung by the jiutai,
    who speaks for the boy, and accompanied by the percussion instruments in
    strict rhythmic setting, and the nohkan with three non-congruent patterns.
    These bring the Intermedia Index almost to its highest possible value. The
    points of intermedia interest are in the music articulating the narrative’s
    meaning and structure, and the use of mimetic movement illustrating the
    narrative while providing a gradual formal build-up.
  </p>

  <p>
    The text tells the story of first century Yamato-dake, the son of legendary
    Emperor Keikō, and the exploits of his sword <em>Kusanagi no tsurugi</em>.
    Based on the narrative, the <em>kuse</em> can be divided into three parts.
    The shite remains kneeling in center stage during the first two. He performs
    mimetic <em>kata</em> during the third part, providing the text, that
    recounts the exploits of the <em>Kusanagi no tsurugi</em>, with a visual
    representation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first two parts develop its narrative through stages, deliniated by the
    shite's salient three <em>ageha</em> and two entrances of the nohkan. In the
    static first part, small and rare movements take on particular significance.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first lines of text introduce Yamato-dake. It refers to his journey that
    took him East, where

    <time datetime="00:21:09.000" title="00:21:09"
      >he subdued the barbarians</time
    >. The nohkan’s first entrance highlights this exploit with the

    <a href="/music/nohkan-examples/#naka-no-takane" target="_blank"
      ><em>naka no takane</em></a
    >

    pattern. After learning that Yamato-dake yearned to come home, the music
    slows down as the shite recalls being kept away by battles in his

    <time datetime="00:22:34.000" title="00:22:34"> first <em>ageha</em> </time
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tempo picks up as the jiutai invokes images of

    <time datetime="00:22:52.000" title="00:22:52">the battlefield</time>

    with gory details, heightened by the nohkan’s second entrance and the

    <a href="/music/nohkan-examples/#takane-mi-kusari" target="_blank"
      ><em>takane mi kusari</em></a
    >

    pattern. As the description concludes, the boy makes his very first move as
    he <time datetime="00:23:46.000" title="00:23:46"> slides left</time> to
    face Munechika, thus reminding the audience that this story is told for his
    sake. A slow-down and transitional

    <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#Uchikiri" target="_blank"
      ><em>uchikiri</em></a
    >

    prepare for an introduction to the next battle.
  </p>

  <p>
    We learn at the beginning of the second part, that at the time, the autumnal
    colors were fading away. The shite, who now stands for Yamato-dake, slides
    to the right,

    <a href="/movement/wig/" target="_blank">grabs his forelock</a>, rises to
    his knee, and

    <time datetime="00:24:47.000" title="00:24:47">stares in the distance</time>

    at the fading fall colors. But the circumstances will soon become dire.
    Right after the second <em>ageha</em>, in which Yamato-dake recounts being

    <time datetime="00:25:10.000" title="00:25:10"
      >surrounded by barbarians</time
    >, we learn that the enemies set the grass around him on fire. His

    <time datetime="00:25:12.000" title="00:25:12"
      >Right-Left-Right Head motion
    </time>

    shows him assessing the danger. The intensity of the moment is underscored
    by the nohkan’s
    <a href="/music/nohkan/hishigi-takane" target="_blank"
      ><em>hishigi takane mi kusari</em></a
    >

    pattern, its last entrance. A moment later, as the jiutai refers to the “<em
      >enemies’ beating war drums</em
    >”, his

    <time datetime="00:25:45.000" title="00:25:45">Downward Head motion</time>,
    suggests that the warrior is considering his options. Finally, as the jiutai
    refers to “<em>…the towering flames as the attack blazed forward,</em>"
    Yamato-dake, about to draw his sword, assesses the situation for the last
    time as he

    <time datetime="00:25:57.000" title="00:25:57">half-rises on his knee</time>

    and faces front, then right.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>kuse’s</em> third part showcases Yamato-dake’s sword prowess. Helped
    by the kotsuzumi's patterns, which incorporate up-beat strokes, the overall
    tempo is faster than the preceding section, and the mimetic dance reaches
    its peak.
  </p>

  <p>
    As the shite sings “the

    <em
      ><time datetime="00:26:10.000" title="00:26:10"
        >Prince drew his sword,</time
      ></em
    >”, he uses his fan as a sword, pointing it straight in front of him. He
    then stands up and takes four steps towards the strong Square 4, where he
    performs two standard <em>kata</em>, often used at the beginning of a dance:
    <a href="/movement/forward-point/" target="_blank">Forward Pointing</a>

    and

    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>. Then, he
    provides the line “As it mowed down the grasses in all directions”, with a
    visual representation, by lashing his fan

    <time datetime="00:26:44.000" title="00:26:44">left and right</time>, still
    using it as a sword.
  </p>

  <p>
    As he performs a sequence of Four Stamps, the shite Opens the Fan, marking
    the start of the dance’s high point. He takes a series of steps that bring
    him from front to back-stage (Square 8), temporarily

    <time datetime="00:26:50.000" title="00:26:50"> relaxing the tension</time>.
    From this point on, the shite rebuilds momentum by performing a

    <a href="/movement/scooping-point/" target="_blank">Scooping Point</a>

    that carries him back to the strong Square 4 where he performs a

    <a href="/movement/circlet/" target="_blank">Right Circlet</a>

    to mimic the words

    <em
      >“<time datetime="00:27:11.000" title="00:27:11"
        >The blaze lit up the heavens, covered the earth! </time
      >”</em
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon hearing the words “<em
      ><time datetime="00:27:15.000" title="00:27:15"
        >A furnace of fierce flames, turned back to devour the enemy
        forces</time
      ></em
    >”, he moves to the very strong Square 3, glances Left-Right-Left-Right-Down
    at the enemy, and uses his fan to aim the flames towards the barbarians,
    Pointing to the Right as he is

    <a href="/movement/take-the-corner/" target="_blank">Taking the Corner</a>.
    Then, he starts a Large Circle to the Left, but stops on Square 5 to perform
    a Scooping Point, followed by a Single Right Stamp that marks

    <time datetime="00:27:26.000" title="00:27:26"
      >a sudden slowdown in the tempo</time
    >, announcing the dance’s imminent conclusion. As the jiutai sings “<em
      >So in later years</em
    >”, the speed drops, suggesting that the narration of Yamato-dake’s exploits
    is over. On his way back to Square 8, the shite Closes his Fan, confirming
    that the dance is coming to an end, and upon reaching his destination, he
    concludes the dance commemorating Yamato-dake’s exploits with the standard
    sequence of Scooping Point, and an Open-retreat.
  </p>

  <p>
    The words “<em
      ><time datetime="00:28:05.000" title="00:28:05">And now…</time></em
    >” confirm the narration of Yamato-dake’s story is over. The return to the
    present also implies that the jiutai is now speaking for the young boy. As
    it intones “<em
      >And now, this auspiciously omened blade that you must forge,</em
    >”, the tempo gradually increases to underline the urgency of the task
    ahead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, the boy turns towards Munechika and

    <time datetime="00:28:10.000" title="00:28:10"
      >takes one step towards him,</time
    >

    but, feeling he must stress his point more strongly, he turns back and goes
    to Square 1. After pivoting to face Munechika, he performs a Scooping Point
    and, while insistently pointing his fan, he Takes Six Steps towards the
    swordsmith just as the jiutai sings “<em
      >Munechika, heir to a house of proud tradition, set your heart at rest and
      go home now.</em
    >” By this point, the tempo has gradually slowed to its lowest point, and
    the boy, standing center-stage, concludes the <em>kuse</em> with an
    Open-retreat and Kneels. He finishes the <em>shōdan</em> at the same place
    and in the same position as he started.

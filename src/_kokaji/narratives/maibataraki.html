<section id="intermedia" title="Intermedia" class="tabbed-narrative">
  <p>
    The <em>maibataraki</em> has the highest Index of Intermedia in the play. It
    is a fast and energetic dance accompanied by congruent nohkan with the three
    percussion instruments in strict rhythm. Whereas the <em>kuse</em> and
    <em>kiri</em> are dance-to-text, the <em>maibataraki</em> is an instrumental
    dance based primarily on abstract yet expressive <em>kata</em>. The word
    "<em>maibataraki</em> " is a combination of <em>mai</em>, signifying pure
    dance, and <em>hataraki</em>, referring to mimetic dances from the early
    days of Noh. In Kokaji’s case, it can be understood as a scene in which the
    deity descends from the heavens and shows off his power before taking part
    in the sword forging.
  </p>
  <p>
    Musically, the dance has a three-section structure: <em>kakari, ji,</em> and
    <em>dan</em>. The dance structure loosely matches the musical one, with the
    <em>kakari</em> serving as a stamping introduction, <em>ji</em> for opening
    the stage-space and overtaking its powerful center, and
    <em>dan</em> providing closure and return toward the back of the stage.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that because of great complexity and limited space on the page
    the percussion score shows only the taiko part.
  </p>

  <h3>Kakari</h3>
  <p>
    The <em>kakari</em>, abbreviated in the score as 'Ka,' is two-<em>honji</em>
    long and matches the introductory stamping of the shite. The word "<em
      >kakari</em
    >
    " can be translated as ‘taking the time to perform something,’ or
    'initiating something.' In the case of the <em>maibataraki</em>, the
    <em>kakari</em> establishes the dance’s dynamic and upbeat mood. The shite
    customarily performs stamps at the beginning of a dance, as if calling the
    listener to attention. The dance opens with a sequence of

    <a href="/movement/six-stamps/" target="_blank">Six Stamps</a>, each one
    inphase with one of the percussionists’ strokes. The first one is also in
    phase with the very first note of the nohkan, which plays in a congruent
    setting for the second and last time in the play.
  </p>

  <h3>Ji</h3>
  <p>
    The form of this section, abbreviated in the score as 'Ji,' is musically led
    by the nohkan’s patterns, while the dance initiates an opening of the
    stage-space, taking the shite to the strong center-stage position. The
    nohkan introduces its core sequence of

    <time datetime="00:53:27.000" title="00:53:27">three patterns</time>

    that we labelled in the score as a, b, and c, each lasting one
    <em>honji</em>. The sequence is played twice. It opens and closes with the
    distinguishable

    <a href="/music/taiko-head" target="_blank"><em>kashira</em></a>

    head-patterns of the taiko.
  </p>
  <p>
    Against this temporal framework the shite traverses first the right lateral
    (<a href="/staging/stage/#Squares" target="_blank">Squares 1 to 3</a>), then
    the front stage (Square 3 to 5), and finally the left-right transversal
    (Square 5 to 8). This trajectory not only opens up the stage-space, it also
    creates a spatial wave of tension-release. The backstage positions of
    Squares 1 and 8, as positions of rest, are often used as starting and
    closing positions for a dance and its various sections. On the other hand,
    front-stage positions of Squares 3, 4, 5 and the center-stage Square 9,
    offer strength and energy. Therefore, in the sequence the motion Square 1 to
    3 builds momentum, Square 3 to 5 maintains it, and Square 5 to 8 releases
    tension. It is interesting to note that this sequence of expansion of the
    stage-space in the <em>maibataraki </em> is identical to Hashitomi’s
    <em>jonomai’s</em>

    <a href="/hashitomi/#startTime=01:03:21" target="_blank">second section</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Dan</h3>

  <p>
    The temporal boundaries of this four-<em>honji</em> closing section,
    abbreviated in the score as 'Cl,' are articulated by the <em>hayashi</em>.
    The nohkan initiates this with

    <time datetime="00:53:50.000" title="00:53:50">two new</time>

    one-<em>honji</em> patterns (which we labelled 'd', and 'e' in the score),
    followed by a return of the pattern ‘a’ and the cadential pattern

    <a href="/music/nohkan/tomenote" target="_blank"><em>tome</em></a
    >. The <em>dan’s</em> four <em>honji</em> also coincide with the taiko’s
    second cycle, its duration once again delineated by the
    <em>kashira</em> patterns. Finally, the taiko’s dropping out in the
    <em>dan’s</em> first <em>honji </em> creates a sudden change of density that
    helps distinguish its beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the <em>dan</em>, the shite occupies center-stage where he performs a

    <time datetime="00:53:46.000" title="00:53:46">series of impressive </time>

    <em>kata</em> that reinforce his image as a powerful being. The sequence
    starts with Two Large Steps and a

    <a href="/movement/jumps/" target="_blank">Jump Kneel</a>, followed by a

    <a href="/ movement/multiple/" target="_blank">Double-Kneel</a>, and a Flip
    Left Sleeve. This is followed with a

    <a href="/movement/circlet/" target="_blank">Right Circlet</a>

    and a Circle back to Square 1, where he performs an

    <a href="/movement/open-retreat/" target="_blank">Open-retreat</a>, a

    <em>kata</em> often used as a closing gesture.

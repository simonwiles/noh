    The Intermedia Index rises as the music of the <em>noriji 1</em> becomes
    congruent with the poetic text, set in <em>ōnori</em>, and the accompaniment
    of the three percussion instruments in strict rhythmic setting. The
    intermedia interest of the <em>noriji 1</em> lies in how it raises the
    energy and creates a transition between the adjacent <em>shōdan</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, the <em>noriji-1</em> is

    <time datetime="00:48:40.000" title="00:48:40"> visually static</time>.
    Munechika kneels on the

    <a href="/staging/props/#Kokaji" target="_blank"><em>dais</em></a>

    motionless as he announces that he is going to pray. The jiutai delivers the
    prayer, the density increasing in comparison to the single voice in the
    preceding <em>notto</em>. A moment later, Munechika begins to wave a sacred
    wand as the jiutai speaks for him, calling for divine help. The music builds
    momentum with its faster tempo and larger instrumentation, as the taiko has
    now joined the two hand-percussion instruments.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>noriji 1</em> leads to the <em>hayafue</em>, the entrance music that
    will bring on stage the second-act shite, personifying a divine being. The
    text and tempo artfully provide the prayer with a tone of intense reverence.
    Set in <em>ōnori</em>, the poetic text counts on average eight syllables per
    <em>honji</em>. In preparation for the swordsmith’s statement of entreaty,
    “<em>hear and grant my prayer</em>”, the tempo slows down when the taiko
    pattern switches
    <time datetime="00:50:29.000" title="00:50:29">
      from two to one stroke per beat</time
    >. This leads to the dramatic line “<em
      ><time datetime="00:50:51.000" title="00:50:51">kinjo-saihai</time></em
    >”, indicating a prayer. At this point, the text setting switches to
    non-congruent and slows to three syllables per <em>honji</em>. The waki
    sings the first word, the jiutai the second. Against the slow-down in the
    vocal line, the percussion instruments create an accelerando that sets the
    tone for the dynamic <em>hayafue</em> and the entrance of the second-act
    shite.

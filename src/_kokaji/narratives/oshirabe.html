    <em>Oshirabe</em> exemplifies the expressive use of intermedia at its
    minimum. The spectacle begins with only music sounding from behind the
    curtain. The instruments are heard sequentially, starting with the nohkan
    followed by the kotsuzumi, the ōtsuzumi, and the taiko, completing the
    <em>hayashi</em>. There is no singing, and the percussionists do not utter
    any

    >. After a minute or two, the <em>oshirabe</em> concludes as the musicians
    drop out, one after the other, in reverse order. Music performed invisibly
    is at its most fleeting. The audience hears a mere ‘ghost’ of it. The
    absence of other elements intensifies the anticipation. As the viewers fall
    into silence, they get to appreciate the visual aspects of the stage in the
    atmosphere evoked by the music. This minimalistic beginning is a perfect
    starting point for a slow and gradual intermedia development -the essence of
    a Noh play.

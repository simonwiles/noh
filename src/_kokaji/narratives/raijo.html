      The full <em>hayashi</em> performs the <em>raijo</em>. For exit of the two
      protagonists, the music includes a percussion part in

      The shite takes over two minutes to exit. When he reaches the Second Pine,
      the waki stands up and follows him. After they both have left, the kyōgen
      enters. The curtain rises for each of them individually.

    The <em>Ageuta 3</em>, concluded with the nohkan's shrilling

    <a href="/music/nohkan-examples/#hishigi">hishigi</a>

    pattern, setting up an exciting tone for the deity’s vanishing. The
    <em>raijo</em> releases that energy.

  <p>
    The slow and non-congruent first part accompanies the exit of the two
    protagonists, while its congruent second part accompanies the kyōgen’s
    entrance. The shite is the first one to leave. The waki follows, but he does
    not enter the bridge

    <time datetime="00:33:08.000" title="00:33:08"
      >until the shite has left</time
    >. The curtain rises and lowers for the exit of each actor. It rises one
    last time for the entrance of the kyōgen actor.

    The nohkan is the featured instrument, accompanied by the three percussion
    instruments whose respective rhythmic patterns merge into a single
    macro-rhythm. Since one cannot predict how long the exit and entrance of an
    actor will last, musicians follow the <em>mihakarai</em> principle. This is
    a concept of temporal flexibility in which the number of repetitions of a
    pattern is determined by the action on stage. In this case, the time the
    actors take to exit and enter the stage determines the number of
    repetitions. The taiko player, who sits in front of the bridge, introduces a
    sequence of three

    <a href="/music/taiko/#Strokes" target="_blank"><em>shōnobachi</em></a>

    strokes on the <em>honji's</em> seventh beat, and shortens his
    <em>kakegoe</em>

    <time datetime="00:34:06.000" title="00:34:06">to communicate</time>

    to the other musicians the move to congruency and increase in tempo.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the beginning of the <em>raijo</em>, the shite takes

    <time datetime="00:31:20.000" title="00:31:20">three special footsteps</time
    >, each performed solemnly, synchronized with the <em>kakegoe ‘ho’</em> on
    beats 2.5 and 6.5. Each step symbolizes the shite traveling a long distance
    at a very fast speed. After the third step, the shite walks out in standard
    fashion.

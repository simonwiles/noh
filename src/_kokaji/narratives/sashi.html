    Although the shite joins the jiutai in singing the <em>sashi</em>, the
    Intermedia Index is lowered because this non-congruent
    <em>sashinori</em> chant is accompanied by the percussion instruments in
    flexible and nohkan part in non-congruent rhythmic settings. The decrease in
    the Intermedia Index is also a result of the absence of any stage movement
    as the two protagonists remain motionless, almost until the end of the
    <em>shōdan</em>.

    The text tells the story of another ancient Chinese sword, and while the
    shite and jiutai sing, they are not in dialogue since the jiutai simply
    completes the boy’s sentences. While the text of the next
    <em>shōdan</em> focuses on a legendary Japanese sword, the
    <em>sashi’s</em> text concludes the stories related to Chinese swords
    started in the preceding <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>kuri</em>. The
    <em>sashi</em> closes with an uptick of energy when the nohkan enters with
    the <em>kuse no ryō</em> pattern over the line, “<em
      ><time datetime="00:19:09.000" title="00:19:09"
        >and their miraculous power is beyond expression!</time
      ></em
    >” as the shite turns to make eye contact with the waki.

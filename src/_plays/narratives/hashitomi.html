            First act: A monk, performing a ritual celebrating flowers, notices
            with bewilderment a white one that seems to smile. He asks its name.
            A woman's voice identifies it as a <em>yūgao</em>, an ‘evening
            flower.’
          </p>

          <p>
            Interlude: A local villager in a conversation with the monk tells
            the story of Lady Yūgao. We learn that passing through Gojō on his
            way to visit his mistress Lady Rokujō, Prince Genji admired the
            abundant yūgao flowers growing on a dwelling. He asked his retainer,
            Koremitsu, to pick some. The blossoms came on a scented fan with a
            poem written on it by a beautiful woman, later referred to as Lady
            Yūgao. Genji replied with his own, leading to a romantic tryst. The
            relationship was short-lived, though, as Lady Yūgao became possessed
            by a vengeful spirit.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second Act: The monk visits the house of Lady Yūgao in Gojō. Her
            spirit appears and reminisces about her first night with Genji,
            their introduction through yūgao flowers, and the poems they wrote
            to each other on a fan.

        <h3 class="collapsible collapsible-closed">Intermedia Form</h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            The

            <a href="/form/#shodanmap" target="_blank"><em>Shōdan</em> Map</a>

            under the video represents the play’s intermedia form. It also shows
            that the play is composed of two acts, the first one comprised of
            eight <em>shōdan</em>, and the second act comprised of nine.
          </p>

          <p>
            The background color grouping blocks shows that most

            <em>shōdan</em> are bound into <em>dan</em>. Act I has four

            <em>dan</em>: Waki Enters, Shite Enters, Dialogue, and Shite Exits;
            Act II has five: Waki Waits, Shite Re-enters, Dialogue, Shite
            Performs, and Shite Exits. Bringing the cursor over a

            <em>shōdan</em> identifies its name and the <em>dan</em> to which it
            belongs.
          </p>

          <p>
            A comparison between the duration of the two acts shows that the
            first one is about half the duration of the second, suggesting that
            the setting-up of the plot in the first act is simpler and less
            elaborate than the developments in the second act.
          </p>

          <p>
            The height of the blocks shows the development of the play’s

            <a href="/IoI/" target="_blank">Index of Intermedia</a> (IoI). The
            different heights demonstrate that the development is not linear but
            comes in waves. We have identified three kinds of waves:
          </p>

          <p>
            First: the rising wave within a <em>dan</em>. In the first act, the
            IoI of each <em>dan</em> forms a wave leading to a peak on its last
            <em>shōdan</em>. For example, the First act’s Waki Enters is
            composed on three <em>shōdan</em>, whose index increases
            exponentially from the first to the third. The development of the
            IoI over the two <em>shōdan</em> of the Shite Enters is similar.
            Things are different though, with the remaining two <em>dan</em>.
            The Dialogue, composed of only one <em>shōdan</em>, is followed by
            the Shite Exits, which has two. In this case, it is over their
            combined three <em>shōdan</em> that the IoI increases exponentially.
          </p>

          <p>
            Second: the rising wave across an act. There is an important
            difference in the way the IoI of each act transforms. The first act
            contains three waves. The first two correspond to the entrance of
            the waki and shite, respectively. The third one corresponds to the
            setting of the play’s premise. On the other hand, there is only one
            wave in the second act, as the IoI of subsequent <em>dan</em> keeps
            increasing until the instrumental dance in the Shite Performs
            <em>dan</em>. These waves suggest a gradual but hesitant setting-up
            of the plot in the first act, followed by a continuous and steady
            development in the second one.
          </p>

          <p>
            Third: the rising wave of the play as a whole. The IoI is at its
            lowest at the beginning of Act I, while its three highest peaks
            create a wave that culminates on the third one. Because the play’s
            premise is already set, the IoI at the beginning of Act II is higher
            than it was at the beginning of Act I, but lower than the first
            act’s peak. But it does not take long for the IoI to exceed the
            first act’s peak when reaching the highest IoI with the instrumental
            dance.

        <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">
          Composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>dan</em> sets up the scene
          for the main character to appear. As it is usually the case, this role
          is assigned to the secondary actor, the waki.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="3,4,5">
          As expected, the <em>dan’s</em> overall Intermedia Index is low. It
          remains non-congruent throughout the expansion of its textures.
          However, the index’s progression over its three
          <em>shōdan</em> displays a gradual increase in intermedia complexity.
          The resulting rise of momentum helps prepare the stage for the
          upcoming entrance of the shite.

          played by the nohkan. It accompanies the waki as he walks towards the
          stage. The melody’s free-flowing and calm tone creates a serene
          ambiance, fitting for the entrance of a Buddhist monk.

        <p data-highlight-shodans="4">
          Upon reaching Square 1, one of stage’s most restful positions, the

        <h3 data-highlight-shodans="6,7">Shite Enters</h3>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="6,7">
          The <em>dan’s</em> function is to introduce the protagonist. However,
          the shite interrupts his entrance at the First Pine, though, delaying
          his entry onto the stage-proper for a later <em>dan</em>. Composed of
          only two <em>shōdan</em>, it is non-congruent throughout. The overall
          Intermedia Index is low since this all occurs in the
          character-introduction phase of the play.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="6">
          Like the preceding <em>dan</em>, this one also opens with a
          non-congruent

          <time datetime="00:08:56.000" title="00:08:56"> entrance music </time
          >, the <em>Ashirai</em>. This time it is performed by the nohkan
          accompanied by the two percussion instruments. This is the first
          <em>shōdan</em> involving the full <em>hayashi</em>.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="7">
          While the waki introduces himself in spoken prose, the shite uses
          poetry, performing the Song in unmetered <em>sashinori</em>

          <time datetime="00:13:02.000" title="00:13:02">chant</time>. This
          raises the Intermedia Index in preparation for the next <em>dan</em>,
          the dialogue.

        </p>

        <h3 data-highlight-shodans="8">Dialogue</h3>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="8">
          The Dialogue section consists of a single <em>shōdan</em>. Its
          function is to set the play’s premise through an exchange between the
          two actors. As it is often the case,this <em>dan</em> portrays the
          waki's curiosity about the shite’s identity.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="8">
          The overall Intermedia Index stays low. The <em>shōdan</em> returns

          <time datetime="00:14:02.000" title="00:14:02">
            to spoken prose
          </time>

          but includes also some chanting in unmetered <em>sashinori</em>, and
          engages both shite and waki.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="8">
          The <em>dan</em> is also significant dramatically. The shite not only
          enters the stage-proper, but also establishes contact with the waki.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="8">
          Formally, the <em>dan</em> appears to be a preparation for the next
          one: the Shite Exits. The Intermedia Index shows an energetic curve
          starting with the Dialogue, which climaxes with the <em>Ageuta 1</em>,
          in the Shite Exits <em>dan</em>.

        <h3>Shite Performs</h3>

        <p>
          There is no Shite Performs <em>dan</em> in Hashitomi’s first act. The

          <em>shōdan</em> that traditionally defines this <em>dan</em> – the

          <em>Kuse</em> – is included in the second act.
        </p>

        <h3 data-highlight-shodans="9,10,11">Shite Exits</h3>

        <p>
          The <em>dan</em> concludes the setting of the play's premise and
          prepares for its development in Act II, before the shite leaves the
          stage. The Intermedia Index slope shows that the <em>dan</em>
          maintains the momentum from the preceding one before reaching the peak
          of Act I. It then drops dramatically to a silent and slow exit.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="9,10,11">
          The <em>dan</em> consists of two <em>shōdan</em>. As a pair, the two
          <em>shōdan</em> could be compared to the

          <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/rongi" target="_blank"><em>rongi</em></a
          >, a <em>shōdan</em> commonly used to close Act I. They follow the
          same structure: the first part here, the <em>Kakaru 2</em>,is a

          <time datetime="00:17:29.000" title="00:17:29"> dialogue</time>

          partially spoken and partially sung in non-congruent setting, followed
          by a <time datetime="00:18:53.000" title="00:18:52">poetic</time> and
          congruent chant, here, the <em>Ageuta 1</em>.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="9">
          The <em>Kakaru 2</em> flows freely as a non-congruent chant with text
          in prose, accompanied by the percussion instruments in flexible
          setting. It is delivered as the two protagonists remain essentially
          motionless in their respective positions. The
          <em>shōdan</em> concludes with a clue about the shite’s identity. The
          <em>Kakaru 2</em> refers to a mansion whose location is then
          identified at the very beginning of the next <em>shōdan</em>.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="10">
          This important moment in the dramatic unfolding of the play is
          underlined by the <em>Ageuta 1</em> , which introduces the first
          congruent chant in the play and the first entrance of the jiutai.
          Moreover, in preparation for his exit, and for the first time in the
          play, the shite performs a sequence of <em>kata</em>.

          The function of the Shite Re-enters <em>dan</em> is to re-introduce
          the shite, now, in his new guise. The Kongō school’s

          <em>utaibon</em> describes the first act shite as a woman, the second
          act one as the woman’s spirit, the

          The <em>dan</em> is composed of three <em>shōdan</em>, and brings the
          first definitive move towards congruency, raising the Intermedia
          Index, which will peak with the instrumental dance. Although the first
          <em>shōdan</em> in the sequence is still non-congruent, it expands the
          overall texture with an <em>einori</em>

          <time datetime="00:40:56.000" title="00:40:56">chant</time> for one
          voice and jiutai, accompanied by a non-congruent nohkan’s part and the
          two hand-percussion instruments already in strict rhythmic setting.
          Two congruent chants follow it, both set in

          <em>hiranori</em> accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments
          still in strict rhythmic setting. The shite sings the

          <time datetime="00:44:42.000" title="00:44:42">first</time> one, and
          the jiutai sings the

          <time datetime="00:45:40.000" title="00:45:40">second</time> one.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="15,16,17">
          The rapid development of the <em>dan’s</em> musical texture
          counterbalances the absence of any dance movements. However, the
          staging increases the visual impact in two steps. First, the shite’s
          entrance is strictly aural, since he sings the

          <em>issei</em>-chant from inside the <em>tsukurimono</em> draped in a
          violet cloth, thus remaining invisible. This creates great mystery and
          builds anticipation. Finally, about half-way in the <em>ageuta</em>,
          the spirit is made visible when the drape around the
          <em>tsukurimono</em>
          is slowly removed. However, this time the spirit is mute, as the
          jiutai delivers the chant.

          While the Dialogue <em>dan</em> in Act I established the play’s
          premise, this <em>dan</em> introduces the climax of the play. It

          performed by the shite and the jiutai. Its poetic text is set in

          <em>hiranori</em>, accompanied by the full <em>hayashi</em> with the
          percussion in strict setting, and a non-congruent nohkan. Set for two
          voices instead of one, unlike preceding two chants, this

          <em>shōdan</em> continues to raise the Intermedia Index. Although the
          performance of <em>kata</em> is rather limited – the shite remains
          seated for almost the entire time – in this

          <em>shōdan</em>, the shite walks out from behind the lattice, the

          <em>hashitomi</em>, and asserts his presence on the stage.

          The play's Intermedia Index peaks in this <em>dan</em>. It is composed

          <em>shōdan</em> of the play. Its poetic text set in

          a congruent nohkan part. Following a <em>shōdan</em> that directly
          correlates text and mimetic dance, this one features pure dance in its
          full poetic beauty.

          The final <em>dan</em> consists of two <em>shōdan</em>. The first, the

          <em>Waka</em>, is a momentary interuption from congruency that will
          return with the final <em>shōdan</em>, the <em>Kiri</em>, which
          concludes the play with the second highest Intermedia Index.
        </p>

        <p data-highlight-shodans="21">
          The absence of dance and nohkan in the <em>Waka</em>, both of which
          carried the <em>jonomai</em> for the last fifteen minutes, is
          noticeable. The singing returns to non-congruent

          <time datetime="01:17:26.000" title="01:17:26">chant</time>. However,
          the shite maintains sufficient tension, delivering the poetic text
          standing in the central Square 9, accompanied of the two
          hand-percussion in strict rhythm.

        <p data-highlight-shodans="22">
          The <em>Kiri</em> brings back movement with a

          <em>shōdan</em>, that uses mainly the strongest stage positions, the
          central square 9 and the front of the stage. The jiutai and shite sing
          the poetic text, accompanied by the two hand-percussion instruments in
          strict rhythmic setting. In the final moments, the nohkan returns with
          a closing pattern. The intermedia spectacle ends at full force and
          then dissolves when the audience sees the shite disappear behind the
          <em>hashitomi</em>, as the music slows down dramatically.

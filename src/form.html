<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>Zeami (c.1363- c.1443) is credited with having perfected Noh as it exists today. When it came to form, he adapted the Gagaku concept of modulation and movement called <em>Jo-ha-kyū</em>. The tripartite can be summarized as: <em>Jo</em> - slow, <em>Ha</em> - development / acceleration, and <em>Kyū</em> - fast conclusion, suggesting that most efforts should start slowly, speed up, before rapidly ending. Zeami expanded the model from three to five sections by nesting the <em>Jo-ha-kyū</em> concept within the <em>Ha</em>, the tripartite’s longest section. Thus, his adaptation can be summarized as: <em>Jo, Ha-jo, Ha-ha, Ha-kyū, Kyū</em>.</p>

<p>Eventually, the principle of <em>Jo-ha-kyū</em> was applied to various levels of organization. For instance, its basic idea of acceleration has shaped <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/nanori" target="_blank">declamation</a> and <a href="/movement/forward/" target="_blank">movements</a>, among others.</p>

<h3 id="Dan">Dan</h3>

<p>It is the modern scholar, Mario Yokomichi (1916-2012) who created a framework to understand the form of Noh play. Referencing Zeami’s five-section concept, he analyzed the form of typical two acts’ Noh plays attributed to Zeami. Then, he has formulated that each act consists of five sections called <em>dan</em>, that represent common events in the dramatic development of a Noh play.  These are:</p>

<table class="content-table">

<td class="content-table__column"></td>

          <td class="content-table__column">Shite Enters</td>
          <td class="content-table__column">Dialogue</td>
          <td class="content-table__column">Shite Performs</td>
          <td class="content-table__column">Shite Exits</td></tr>
          <tr class="content-table__row--header">

<td id="Act2" class="content-table__column">Act II (<em>nochi ba</em>)</td>

<td class="content-table__column"></td>
<td class="content-table__column"></td>
<td class="content-table__column"></td>
<td class="content-table__column"></td>
</tr>
  <tr class="content-table__row">
          <td class="content-table__column">Waki Waits</td>
          <td class="content-table__column">Shite Re-enters</td>
          <td class="content-table__column">Dialogue</td>
          <td class="content-table__column">Shite Performs</td>
          <td class="content-table__column">Shite Exits</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The above categorizations agree with the traditional divisions shared by actors and musicians. However, we need to acknowledge that the Zeami/Yokomichi’s model is an ideal meant only to help the understanding of an act and facilitate comparisons between plays.  It is not uncommon that some Noh plays lack certain <em>dan</em>. </p>

<h3 id="shodan">Shōdan</h3>
<p> According to Yokomichi, a <em>dan</em> consists of one or more <em>shōdan</em>. These are conventional units of form that have their own position and syntactical role within a <em>dan</em>. The word <em>shōdan</em>, meaning ‘small dan’, was coined by Mario Yokomichi to further explain the hierarchical character of the form of a Noh play. There are about one hundred different kinds of <em>shōdan</em> that can be categorized into four types: Spoken, Chanted, Entrance and Exit music, and Dance music. Each <em>shōdan</em> is also characterized by a particular combination of poetry or prose, rhythmic setting, melodic shape, and instrumentation. </p>

<p>The same shōdan can be found in various plays. For instance, the majority of Noh plays include a <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/nanori/" target="_blank"><em>nanori</em></a>, a spoken introduction presented by the secondary actor. It can be found <a href="/hashitomi/nanori/" target="_blank">in Hashitomi</a> as well as <a href="/kokaji/nanori/" target="_blank">in Kokaji</a>. Moreover, the same shōdan, such as the main chant <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/ageuta/" target="_blank"><em>ageuta</em></a> for instance, can be used more than once in a play. For example, Hashitomi has two while Kokaji has three. For more information and video examples of <em>shōdan</em> please refer to the <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/" target="_blank">Catalog of Shōdan</a>.</p>

<p> This  <a href="/form-appendix/" target="_blank">appendix</a> provides information on the <em>shōdan</em> commonly associated with the various <em>dan</em>. It is presented solely as a reference-model, since a comparison limited to Hashitomi and Kokaji's form would already show that deviations from that model are not at all uncommon.</p>

<h3 id="modularity">Modularity</h3>
<p>Thus, the construction of Noh plays, made of sequences of <em>dan</em>, themselves composed of <em>shōdan</em>, is said to be modular. In Noh, the concept of modularity is not exclusively found at the overall formal level, but also within individual media layers such as dance and music. For instance, the nohkan’s melodic patterns are themselves sequenced from shorter modules. The nohkan player varies the patterns' expression to adapt them to given contexts, as illustrated with these examples: <a href="/music/nohkan/nakanotakane/" target="_blank"><em>naka no takane</em></a> and <a href="/music/nohkan/takanemikusari/" target="_blank"><em>takane mi kusari</em></a>. </p>

<p>The patterns played by the percussionists are similarly constructed and controlled. This <a href="/music/otsuzumi-kotsuzumi/#patterns" target="_blank">example</a> shows how the rhythms played by the ōtsuzumi and kotsuzumi performers for an <a href="/catalog-of-shodan/ashirai" target="_blank"><em>Ashirai</em></a>, involve the juxtaposition of <em>mitsuji</em> and <em>tsuzuke</em> patterns. It also illustrates how their expression is altered when the rhythmic setting is strict compared to flexible.</p>

<p>Similarly, dances are constructed using a limited number of movements (<em>kata</em>) that are reused within a dance, a play, and even across plays. Moreover, modularity can be seen in the way that some <em>kata</em> are designed. For instance, the <a href="/movement/back-circlet/" target="_blank">Back Circlet</a> is composed of the sequence of two shorter <em>kata</em>: a Right Step pivot followed by an Open-retreat.  Similarly to music, the unifying impact of modularity is balanced by changing expressive interpretation of patterns performed in a different context. This is shown in a comparison of <a href="/movement/large-zigzag/" target="_blank">two versions</a> of the Large Zigzag: first, as it is performed by a pensive ghost of a young woman in Hashitomi and second, in martial style as performed by the vigorous diety in Kokaji. For more examples of <em>kata</em> please refer to the <a href="/movement/" target="_blank">Catalog of <em>Kata</em></a>.</p>
